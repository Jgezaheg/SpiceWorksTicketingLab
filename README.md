  select create

There are a number of things that can happen to the ticket after its creation such as contacting the person who requested help to get more details about the problem or escalating the ticket to an collegue in a higher position. The requester may also find the solution to the problem before you get to the ticket and in that event you would just document what happend and close the ticket accordingly.
